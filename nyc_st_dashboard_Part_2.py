    ### Key Insights: Aggregated Bike Trips in New York
    
    1. **Concentration Near Key Areas**:
       - The most active stations are concentrated near popular landmarks and hubs such as **Streeter Dr & Grand Ave**, **Theater on the Lake**, and other locations near downtown Chicago.
       - These areas likely have a high volume of commuter traffic as well as recreational riders.
    
    2. **Lakefront and Tourist Attractions**:
       - A significant number of trips originate or end along the lakefront, highlighting its appeal as a recreational destination.
       - Locations near Millennium Park and Navy Pier show consistent activity, suggesting their popularity among tourists and locals alike.
    
    3. **Downtown Core as a Connectivity Hub**:
       - Downtown Chicago acts as a central hub for bike trips, with many routes connecting stations in this area to residential neighborhoods and commercial zones.
       - This pattern indicates that many users rely on bikes for last-mile connectivity between public transit and their destinations.
    
    4. **Station Pairings and Commuter Patterns**:
       - Frequently traveled routes include stations near major business districts and residential areas, emphasizing the importance of bikes in daily commuting.
       - For example, high traffic between **Streeter Dr & Grand Ave** and **Theater on the Lake** may indicate commuting between residential areas and workplaces or schools.
    
    5. **Recommendations for Resource Allocation**:
       - **Increase bike availability at key stations**: Stations near downtown and the lakefront should have increased bike stock during peak hours and seasons to accommodate demand.
       - **Enhance connectivity**: Consider adding new stations or improving infrastructure near underserved areas to connect them to the primary bike network.
       - **Targeted campaigns**: Promote biking as a viable transportation option for commuting and recreational use, particularly in high-demand areas such as the downtown core and lakefront.
    
    By analyzing these patterns, Divvy Bikes can improve station management, optimize bike availability, and better cater to the needs of Chicago's diverse biking community.

        st.markdown("""
        - **Recommendation**: Reduce bike availability by approximately **30-40%** during the colder months (November to April).
        - **Rationale**: 
            - Bike usage drops significantly as temperatures fall, especially below freezing.
            - Retain higher availability in downtown and transit hubs to meet commuter needs.
        - **Implementation**: 
            - Analyze trip data to identify stations with low demand during winter.
            - Reallocate resources to high-demand areas for better efficiency.

    with st.expander("2. **Determining How Many More Stations to Add Along the Water**"):
        st.markdown("""
        - **Steps**:
            1. **Analyze Trip Data**:
                - Identify high-demand stations along the waterfront, such as **Streeter Dr & Grand Ave**.
                - Pinpoint areas where station coverage is sparse.
            2. **Heatmap Analysis**:
                - Create heatmaps to visualize bike traffic along the waterfront.
                - Focus on identifying underserved regions.
            3. **User Feedback**:
                - Conduct surveys or feedback sessions to understand user preferences for new stations.
                - Include both casual users (recreational needs) and members (commuting patterns).
            4. **Simulation Models**:
                - Use demand forecasting models to simulate the impact of new stations on overall trip volume and station balance.
            5. **Benchmarking**:
                - Compare lakefront station density with high-demand inland areas, ensuring equitable resource distribution.
    
        - **Rationale**:
            - Adding stations in high-demand waterfront areas improves accessibility for recreational users and boosts overall system coverage.
            - Stations near tourist hotspots can attract more casual riders, driving revenue during peak seasons.
    
        - **Outcome**:
            - Expanded waterfront coverage that caters to both commuting and recreational needs, ensuring balanced bike distribution across the network.

        - **Strategies**:
            - Leverage **real-time monitoring** to track bike availability and redistribute bikes dynamically.
            - Implement **predictive analytics** to forecast demand during peak hours.
            - Provide **user incentives** (e.g., discounts, rewards) for returning bikes to high-demand stations.
            - Deploy **dedicated logistics teams** to prioritize key stations like **West St & Chambers St** and **Central Park South**.
            - Add **overflow docking capacity** at high-traffic locations to avoid bottlenecks during busy periods.
        - **Outcome**: Improved bike availability and reduced wait times at popular stations.

    ### Additional Insights
    - **User Type Trends**:
        - Casual users primarily ride during weekends and summer months, favoring recreational hotspots.
        - Members show consistent usage year-round, indicating commuter reliance on the service.
    - **Seasonal Adjustments**:
        - Ensure robust operations during summer, the peak season for casual users.
        - Scale back resources in winter while maintaining access for members.
    - **Geographic Focus**:
        - Expand station placements in underserved high-traffic areas identified through trip data and heatmaps.
